## Headspring MVC ##

This is my implementation for the Headspring University MVC homework.

## Local Setup ##

You will need a local instance of SQL Server setup as 'SQLEXPRESS'.

Run the build via: build.cmd This will create the database, schema, and any defualt data needed to run the project locally.
